  ## **User-Story**
   AS A user I want an application that provides wellness activities and tracks my wellness goals
  SO THAT I can draw inspiration of new ideas, and evaluate whether or not I am reaching my goals
  WHEN goals are missed, I have the opportunity to start again!
  ## **Description**
 We want to create a goal setting application centered on wellness, where we can add new goals, track daily goals, and monitor progress.

Display homepage. If you are not a “USER” you can see all the suggested activities. When you click on one, it will ask you to log in to save the activity to your daily goals. Tip from API / this is our way to get people to create an account / interact with the app!

Once users are signed up / logged in, users can view wellness dashboard with personalized wellness goals. They can set types of activities to support personal goals, whether it is movement-based, creativity / play, food / water intake, sleep…
